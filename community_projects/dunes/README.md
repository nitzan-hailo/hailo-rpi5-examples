### Key Features

1. **Survivor Detection:**
   - Utilizes AI models trained to recognize signs of life, including body heat, movement, and vocalizations, through sensors such as infrared cameras, LiDAR, and microphones.
   - Equipped to detect survivors in challenging environments like collapsed buildings, dense forests, or underwater.

2. **Autonomous Navigation:**
   - Operates through drones, ground robots, or aquatic vehicles capable of autonomous navigation.
   - Adaptive pathfinding algorithms enable the system to maneuver through debris, navigate hazardous terrains, and access hard-to-reach locations.

3. **Real-Time Communication:**
   - Sends automated alerts with precise GPS coordinates and survivor status to emergency response teams.
   - Provides live feeds and environmental data to aid in planning rescue strategies.

4. **Multi-Unit Coordination:**
   - Deploys multiple units that communicate seamlessly to cover large areas efficiently.
   - Ensures minimal redundancy and maximum coverage through intelligent task allocation.

5. **Scalability:**
   - Can be deployed in various disaster scenarios, including earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and maritime emergencies.
   - Scalable architecture allows integration with existing rescue frameworks and technology.

## Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites - 
1. Rpi5, AI HAT, RpiCam
2. Projector (We used BENQ TH685)
3. Sandbox (We used 80 KG of sand over 50cm X 70cm X 30cm plastic box)
4. We hanged the projector from the ceiling, a picture of our setup can be found [here](https://add.url.here)
5. Extra - We used 3D printed cover for the projector + Rpi. 3D models can be found [here](https://add.url.here)
